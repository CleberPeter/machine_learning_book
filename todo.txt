# Supervised Learning

logistic regression : https://ricardomatsumura.medium.com/regress%C3%A3o-log%C3%ADstica-556d81684bf7
support vector machines
decision tree, ramdom forest
K-nearest neighbors

# Unsupervised Learning
K-means

# Model Selection

Overfitting
split dataset -> train, validation and test workflow (shuffle, learning curve) (validation_error is lower than test_error)
cross validation, k-folds, bootstrapping, nested k fold cross validation

Regularization (bias x variance), minimize theta to smooth model -> final week 3, exercise 2

unbalanced Dataset -> undersampling, oversampling
hyperparameters tunning -> grid search, ramdom search

dimensionality reduction -> PCA, autoencoders
