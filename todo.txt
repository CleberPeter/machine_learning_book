support vector machines
decision tree, ramdom forest
K-nearest neighbors
Overfitting -> Regularization (bias x variance), minimize theta to smooth model -> final week 3, exercise 2
unbalanced Dataset -> undersampling, oversampling
metrics
split dataset -> train, validation and test workflow
cross validation, k-folds, bootstrapping, nested k fold cross validation
grid search, ramdom search
unsupervised learning
